For the work I tried to optimize the parameters of a SVR model using the JAYA algorithm.
This is for my final school project. I have not finished working on this project, when I'm done I will be submitting it to the department as my final year project.
I need help and expert opinion on whether what I'm doing is correct or not and also guidance on how to improve what i have done already if it is correct.
I also used the procedural method to code this, just to make things easy for me to understand and picture the processes. I am learning about OOP hopefully when i have better understanding of that I will refactor the entire work.
Thank you for all the support, kind regards.
